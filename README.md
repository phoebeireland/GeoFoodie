# GeoFoodie

This is a project for people who are looking for new recipes to try. 
Ideally, a user can go onto the site and click a button and be brought to a random recipe from around the world. 
At some point it would be nice to be able to add certain restrictions to the generation of recipes- can filter results by continent, vegetarian/vegan, dietary restrictions etc.
